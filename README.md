# joomlaStrings
python parser for joomla strings

The goal here is to make it easier for developers to find:
- redundant and unused translation keys in ini files
- untranslated strings in their php and xml files

run languageCheck.py from the joomla extension folder you want to analyse

it's a first draft, but it can still be helpfull
